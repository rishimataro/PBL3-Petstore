## VII. Project Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**

  * Version: **21 or higher**
  * Download: [https://jdk.java.net/](https://jdk.java.net/)

2. **Apache Maven**

  * Build tool used to manage dependencies and build the project
  * Download: [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

3. **Database Setup**

  * You can use either:

    * **MySQL** (recommended for ease of integration)
    * **Oracle** (optional)
  * Create a database named (e.g., `petstore_db`) and update connection credentials in the environment file.

4. **Environment Configuration**

  * Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store database connection details.
  * The project uses `dotenv-java` to load environment variables.

   Example `.env` file:

   ```env
   DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/petstore_db
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

---

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd PBL3-Petstore
```

> Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository.

---

### Build the Project with Maven

Make sure you're inside the root project directory (`PBL3-Petstore`), then run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will compile the code and resolve all dependencies.

---

###  Run the Application

You can launch the application using the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean javafx:run
```

> Make sure your system supports JavaFX runtime or set it up via `--module-path` if needed.
